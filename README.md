My Project idea is to develop a Procedural City Generator in Unity

I got my idea from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDSu8uW4eJE&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E6GaGOHiBdPSW0QzICdGs4X&index=32&ab_channel=jackwhelan

The city will randomly generate buldings as you fly thgrough it, have parks, trees, cars and maybe people. I'll see how hard it is to generate people. 

It's going to look cool as there will be a certain amount bulidings of each category the generator can show. 

Skyscrapers, city halls, supermarkets, medium sized buildings, musuem and a few more.

For example, 10 skyscrapers, 20 medium buldings only will be shown, this is to ensure that the city wont just generate 100% Skycrappers.
